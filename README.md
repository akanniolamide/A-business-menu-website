# A-business-card
My business card features a clean and modern design, showcasing my contact information and profession in a clear and concise manner. The HTML structure provides a solid foundation, while CSS styling adds a touch of personality and visual appeal.
Key design elements include:
- Name and Title: prominently displayed in a bold, modern font
- Contact Information: neatly organized and easily readable
- Social Media Links: icons linking to professional profiles
- Color Scheme: a harmonious blend of colors reflecting my personal brand
